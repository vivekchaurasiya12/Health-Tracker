## Getting Started

To get the development environment up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended version: LTS)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (installed globally)

### Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
ng serve

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
